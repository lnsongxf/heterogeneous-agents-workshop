<p>We will be doing two things at once: brainstorming each of the topics, and fleshing out further important topics for a future conference.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intro: survey/preview topics for which we will have roundtable discussions. Two main questions here:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How do we incentivize people broadly to use modular code, participate, and give back?</p>
<ul>
<li>Both professional level and graduate students</li>
<li>platforms for collaboration</li>
<li>Getting citations and peer review for code</li>
<li>Collaborative events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How to identify next round of modules/topics needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>again drive everything with examples</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TOPIC: What is list of models we'd like to see, now or in next 9-36 months, produced with a toolkit?<ul>
<li>everyone likes wishlists.</li>
<li>poll research organizations: "what are current toolkit implementation needs? What would be useful to have?"</li>
<li>poll researchers: models/ideas which would be good to see in same framework? (eg. bequests)</li>
<li>Garner a list beforehand of models for which we'd like examples</li>
<li>Our contribution: two models in progress now; ideas for models which may be useful at CFPB</li>
<li>[Tentative MC: Chris or Nathan. This roundtable will largely target ]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TOPIC: Platforms for collaboration? Issues with Uptake? The CFPB experience.  [Bill kicks off]<ul>
<li>What tools to foster collaboration here? What infrastracture?</li>
<li>Bill talks about general topics and experiences at CFPB</li>
<li>Open-source issues with uptake and collaboration</li>
<li>various collaboration efforts -- econforge, quant-econ, replication-wiki. What interactions might look like.</li>
<li>[MC: Bill kicks this off]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>TOPIC: How to incentivize professional participation?  Options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting a strong early showing of good models (eg at "public launch" -- quant-econ, stackexchange as good example)</p>
<ul>
<li>A theme will be, "examples drive development" -- replication, new research (incl. dissertations, current research, policy models)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Graduate students are the great "natural resource" here - How to attract/encourage their participation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Advisors</li>
<li>Student awards (SCE/CEF)-style awards for particularly useful/desired models</li>
<li>Mentoring of model areas by experienced researchers</li>
<li>Partner with replication wiki to encourage replication with toolkit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Peer review and citations of code -- next topic. "If you cite it they will come."</p>
</li>
<li>[MC: almost anyone. Nathan, Chris, or any of us!]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TOPIC: Citations and peer review of code<ul>
<li>example of JSS: open journal with citations for code via "vignettes" posted to CRAN</li>
<li>idea of "computational appendix" or "computational letters" as low-cost e-jounral.</li>
<li>discussion of IPython and IJulia as tools to do this.</li>
<li>[MC: Pablo / Nathan]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>TOPIC: How to make toolkit universally available?<ul>
<li>We would like the tools to be quickly usable by anyone. One suggestion is to build a Python stack organized with conda, and explicitly outline the requirements.</li>
<li>Another approach is to build out a virtual machine a la Michael Creel</li>
<li>[MC: Pablo / Sylvain / Spencer / Chase -- essentially everyone likely has useful insight]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>TOPIC: Licenses for code?  </p>
<ul>
<li>We don't want to discourage usage.</li>
<li>[MC: Bill / Pablo]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Topic: Events to foster participation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hackathons, Google Summer of Code, "EconExchange"  </li>
<li>[Pablo and / or Bill]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Topic: Stackoverflow for Economists?</p>
<ul>
<li>"Conspiring" for success of the official SE economics</li>
<li>Private options if official one fails</li>
<li>Private options for govt / researchers</li>
<li>[MC: Nathan can kick off]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Nature of next steps</p>
<ul>
<li>eg. connect with SCE</li>
<li>[MC: Nathan, or anyone]</li>
</ul>
