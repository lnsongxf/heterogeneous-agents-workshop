* TOPIC: How to incentivize professional participation?  Options include:
    * Getting a strong early showing of good models (eg at "public launch" -- quant-econ, stackexchange as good example)
        * A theme will be, "examples drive development" -- replication  as well as new research (incl. dissertations, current research, policy models)
        * Offer examples of popular policy models

    * Graduate students are the great "natural resource" here. How to attract/encourage graduate student participation?
        * Advisors
        * Student awards (SCE/CEF)-style awards for particularly useful/desired models (sponsored by journal, and/or 'production' research organizations (policy research insititutions)), or allow "bounties"
        * Mentoring -- experienced researchers adopt code areas, agree to "mentor" graduate students who build out tools in this area. Mentors are not responsible for dissertation, but rather final integrity of code -- act as expert reference for when something particularly unsolvable
        * Partner with replication wiki to encourage replication with toolkit
    * Peer review and citations of code -- next topic. "If you cite it they will come."
    * [MC: almost anyone. Nathan, Chris, or any of "social engineering" folks]
