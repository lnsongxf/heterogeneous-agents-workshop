We will be doing two things at once: brainstorming each of the topics, and fleshing out further important topics for a future conference.

* Intro: survey/preview topics for which we will have roundtable discussions. Two main questions here:
    1. How do we incentivize people broadly to use modular code, participate, and give back?
        * Both professional level and graduate students
        * platforms for collaboration
        * Getting citations and peer review for code
        * Collaborative events

    2. How to identify next round of modules/topics needed?
        * again drive everything with examples


* TOPIC: What is list of models we'd like to see, now or in next 9-36 months, produced with a toolkit?
    * everyone likes wishlists.
    * poll research organizations: "what are current toolkit implementation needs? What would be useful to have?"
    * poll researchers: models/ideas which would be good to see in same framework? (eg. bequests)
    * Garner a list beforehand of models for which we'd like examples
    * Our contribution: two models in progress now; ideas for models which may be useful at CFPB
    * [Tentative MC: Chris or Nathan. This roundtable will largely target ]


* TOPIC: Platforms for collaboration? Issues with Uptake? The CFPB experience.  [Bill kicks off]
    * What tools to foster collaboration here? What infrastracture?
    * Bill talks about general topics and experiences at CFPB
    * Open-source issues with uptake and collaboration
    * various collaboration efforts -- econforge, quant-econ, replication-wiki. What interactions might look like.
    * [MC: Bill kicks this off]


* TOPIC: How to incentivize professional participation?  Options include:
    * Getting a strong early showing of good models (eg at "public launch" -- quant-econ, stackexchange as good example)
        * A theme will be, "examples drive development" -- replication, new research (incl. dissertations, current research, policy models)

    * Graduate students are the great "natural resource" here - How to attract/encourage their participation?
        * Advisors
        * Student awards (SCE/CEF)-style awards for particularly useful/desired models
        * Mentoring of model areas by experienced researchers
        * Partner with replication wiki to encourage replication with toolkit

    * Peer review and citations of code -- next topic. "If you cite it they will come."
    * [MC: almost anyone. Nathan, Chris, or any of us!]


* TOPIC: Citations and peer review of code
    * example of JSS: open journal with citations for code via "vignettes" posted to CRAN
    * idea of "computational appendix" or "computational letters" as low-cost e-jounral.
    * discussion of IPython and IJulia as tools to do this.
    * [MC: Pablo / Nathan]


* TOPIC: How to make toolkit universally available?
    * We would like the tools to be quickly usable by anyone. One suggestion is to build a Python stack organized with conda, and explicitly outline the requirements.
    * Another approach is to build out a virtual machine a la Michael Creel
    * [MC: Pablo / Sylvain / Spencer / Chase -- essentially everyone likely has useful insight]


* TOPIC: Licenses for code?  
    * We don't want to discourage usage.
    * [MC: Bill / Pablo]

* Topic: Events to foster participation?
    * Hackathons, Google Summer of Code, "EconExchange"  
    * [Pablo and / or Bill]

* Topic: Stackoverflow for Economists?
    * "Conspiring" for success of the official SE economics
    * Private options if official one fails
    * Private options for govt / researchers
    * [MC: Nathan can kick off]

* Nature of next steps
    * eg. connect with SCE
    * [MC: Nathan, or anyone]
